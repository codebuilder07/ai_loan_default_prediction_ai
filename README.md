### Loan Default Risk Analytics: EDA for Consumer Lending

Loan providers often face challenges when assessing borrowers with insufficient or non-existent credit histories. Some consumers exploit this gap, leading to defaults. As a data analyst for a consumer finance company specializing in urban customer loans, your task is to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns in the data. This will help ensure that eligible applicants capable of repaying loans are approved, while minimizing the risk of default.

When evaluating loan applications, the company must carefully weigh two types of risks:

1. **Loss of Business**: If an applicant is likely to repay the loan but is denied, the company loses a potential business opportunity.
2. **Financial Loss**: If an applicant is likely to default, approving the loan could result in a financial loss.

### Dataset Overview

The dataset includes three files:

1. **`application_data.csv`**: Contains details about the client at the time of loan application, including indicators of payment difficulties.
2. **`previous_application.csv`**: Provides historical information about the clientâ€™s previous loan applications, including their outcomes (Approved, Cancelled, Refused, or Unused).
3. **`columns_description.csv`**: A data dictionary explaining the variables in the dataset.

### Objective

The primary goal of this EDA is to identify patterns that signal potential difficulties in loan repayment. Insights from this analysis can be used to take appropriate actions, such as:
- Denying the loan to high-risk applicants.
- Adjusting loan amounts.
- Offering loans to high-risk applicants at higher interest rates.

This approach ensures that applicants capable of repaying loans are not unfairly denied, improving decision-making and mitigating risk for the company.
